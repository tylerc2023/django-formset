## Changes

- 0.8.4
  * Add optional argument for delay in milliseconds to button actions `okay` and `bummer`. 
  * Resetting a django-formset removes all just added sibling collections and unmarks all
    collections for removal.
  * Fields beeing hidden on the client using `show-if`/`hide-if` also are disabled to prevent
    validation â€“ which wouldn't make sense anyway.
  * Add parameter `legend` to Form Collection so that a collection can have an optional title.

- 0.8.3
  * Fix: For ``field_css_classes``, fall back to form name rather than its prefix.

- 0.8.2
  * Fix: Set empty dropbox item on upload widget during form reset.
  * Fix: Collections with siblings on root level generated invalid form data.
  * Add special placeholder to render errors for collections with siblings.
  * Add additional actions to button: Spinner, Okay, Bummer and Reload.
  * In Button's proceed action, print a warning, if neither a success-, nor a
    fallback-URL is given to proceed.
  * In `FormCollectionView` handle response of posting formsets analogous to the way
    Django handles forms.

- 0.8.1
  * Adopt `DualSelector` for Tailwind.css.
  * Hide `calendar-picker-indicator` in touched input date fields.
  * Fix: Expecting path for base location as Path object.
  * Fix: Updating of existing object failed.
  * Add method `get_extra_data` to class `FormView`.
  * Increase max filename length to 250 characters.
  * Fix: Abort silently if input field is missing.
  * Replace `<div>`-based progress bar against proper HTML element `<progress>`.

- 0.8
  * Add widget `DualSelector` which accepts multiple values and is the form field counterpart
    to Django's `ManyToManyField`. This is an alternative widget to `SelectizeMultiple`.

- 0.7
  * Add widget `SelectizeMultiple` which accepts multiple values and is the form field counterpart
    to Django's `ManyToManyField`.
  * Bugfix in UploadWidget: Do not delete existing file on form update.

- 0.6
  * Content from `FileUploadWidget` can be transfered to a Django model and vice versa.

- 0.4
  * It is possible to control every aspect of the feedback, given to the user while he fills the
    input fields.
  * Templatetag `render_form` and `formsetify` accepts parameters `form_classes` and
    `collection_classes` for finer styling control.

- 0.3
  * Add `show-if`, `hide-if` and `disable-if` attribute parsing to fields and fieldsets.
  * Add class `Fieldset` to handle forms with legends and the possibility for hiding and disabling.
  * Form Collections may have siblings and can be extended.

- 0.2
  * Refactored to work for Django>4 only.
  * Added Form Collections.

- 0.1
  * Initial release.
