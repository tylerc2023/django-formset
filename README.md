# django-formset â€“ Better UX for Django Forms 

`<django-formset>` is a [Webcomponent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components)
used to wrap one or more Django Forms and/or ModelForms.

## Example

Say, we have a standard Django Form:

```python
from django.forms import forms, fields

class SubscribeForm(forms.Form):
    last_name = fields.CharField(
        label="Last name",
        min_length=2,
        max_length=50,
    )

    # ... more fields
```

then we rendering to HTML, we shall wrap that form into our special Webcomponent:

```html
{% load django_formset %}

<django-formset endpoint="{{ request.path }}">
  <form name="subscribe">
    {% csrf_token %}
    {% render_groups form %}
  </form>
</django-formset>
```

this gives our Subscribe Form a much better **User eXperience**.


## Features

* Before submitting, our Form is prevalidated by the browser using the constraints we defined for
  each field.
* Multiple FormData objects are submitted to an endpoint.
* Server side validation errors are injected back to do form.
* Much better user experience, since form data is sent using Ajax, rather than rerendering everything.


## Documentation

Not deployed on RTD, but some documentation can be found in the `docs` folder.


## Motivation

This library shall replace the form-validation framework in django-angular. In many aspects it already
is far superior than the latter. Currently I am working on the `Selectize`-widget, which shall be used on
Django's `forms.models.ModelChoiceField` and hence be used for `db.models.ForeignKey`.
