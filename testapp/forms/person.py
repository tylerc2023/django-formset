    This is a simple Django Form with just one input field. It is used to show how to use
    "button actions". On each button inside a ``<django-formset>``, we can attach the event handler
    ``<button click="...">`` to a chain of actions. This attribute then contains a list of actions,
    whose most notables are ``submit -> proceed``.

    This example mimicks a form which takes a few seconds for processing. For time-consuming form
    submission, it is good practice to improve the user experience by giving feedback. Here, the
    button tells its caller, that this action may take some time by displaying a spinner.

    On succeeded submission, the button displays an okay tick for 1.5 seconds before proceeding.

    On failed submission, the button displays a bummer symbol to signalize a failure.

class ModelPersonForm(models.ModelForm):
    """
    This form is created by Django's helper functions that creates a Form class out of a Django
    model. Say we have a Django model such as:

    .. code-block:: python

        class PersonModel(models.Model):
            full_name = models.CharField(…)
            avatar = models.FileField(…)
            gender = models.CharField(choices=…, …)
            birth_date = models.DateField(…)
            opinion = models.ForeignKey(OpinionModel, …)
            opinions = models.ManyToManyField(OpinionModel, …)
            continent = models.IntegerField(choices=…, …)

    and create a Django Form out of it, such as

    .. code-block:: python

        from formset.widgets import Selectize, SelectizeMultiple, UploadedFileInput, DualSelector

        class ModelPersonForm(models.ModelForm):
            class Meta:
                model = PersonModel
                fields = '__all__'
                widgets = {
                    'avatar': UploadedFileInput,
                    'gender': widgets.RadioSelect,
                    'opinion': Selectize(search_lookup='label__icontains'),
                    'opinions': SelectizeMultiple(search_lookup='label__icontains', max_items=15),
                           # or DualSelector(search_lookup='label__icontains'),
                }

    here the only caveat is that some of the default widgets must or shall be overridden by
    counterparts from the **django-formset** library. We do this by specifying a dictionary inside
    the form's ``Meta`` class, as shown above.

    For model fields of type ``django.db.models.FileField`` and ``django.db.models.ImageField`` the
    widget **must** be replaced by ``formset.widgets.UploadedFileInput`` as discussed in the
    example 12.

    Input fields for selecting *one option* out of many, shall be replaced by a widget of type
    ``formset.widgets.Selectize``. This replaces the HTML ``<select>`` element against a more
    user-friendly version.

    Input fields for selecting *many options* out of many, shall be replaced by a widget of either
    type ``formset.widgets.SelectizeMutiple`` or ``formset.widgets.DualSelector``.
    The ``SelectizeMutiple`` widget is suitable for input fields holding only a few selected
    choices, while the ``DualSelector`` widget is intended for input fields holding many selected
    options.

    Note that the submitted form data is tight to the current session and thus not visible to other users.
